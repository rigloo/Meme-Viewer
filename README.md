# Meme-Viewer


This is a general purpose image viewer that gets all the image files (png, gif, jpeg) from a given subreddit and puts it in a nice readable scrollview. It
uses the reddit API to accomplish, which to my surprise doesn not need any keys.

Well, you might ask, why not just use the reddit App in order to do this? The reddit app gets all cluttered with its login features and comments and upvotes,
so this app's purpose is to simplify all this and just focus on the memes, no other thing else.
